            <p>Have you ever looked at your own work and wondered how the finished product became what it was when when all was said and done?
              Of course "work" can apply to things such as art, writing, and music.. but in this particular case, I'm specifically talking about the product of coding. 
            </p>

            <p>I took a step back and asked myself some questions about my work because it truly fascinated me. How do I come up with the things that I do?
              Should it be this difficult for me to translate what I see in my head on to what I see on the screen? Why did I go with this particular idea? Do I think I'm funny? 
              Am I borderline psychopathic? You know, questions like that. </p>

            <p>What exactly goes on in in our heads when those little sparks of information are being carried across one end of the brain to the other?
              I suppose there isn't an exact answer for that, but it sure is fascinating to think of all the possibilities.
